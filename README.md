This repository contains the libraries and application source code for my final project of the Cyber Physical Systems 2015 course. The repository consists of three folders: base-station, remote-control, and reports. The base-station folder contains an AES-128 block cipher library which is proviced by Texas Instruments, an nrf24 library for nRF24L01+ radio transceiver ported to Intel Galileo Gen 2 platform, and an application source code for the base station. 
The remote-control folder contains a hybrid scheduler library ported to Arduino Uno, an nrf24 library for nRF24L01+ radio transceiver ported to Arduino Uno, a modified AES-128 block cipher library from Texas Instruments, and an application source code for the remote control which is implemeted based on Arduino Uno.
Finally, the reports folder contains a project proposal document and a project report document for the project. 


Demonstration of the project can be seen at the following Youtube link:
